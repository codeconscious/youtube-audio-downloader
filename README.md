# Youtube Audio Downloader

This is a very simple UI wrapper for [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) using [Avalonia](https://avaloniaui.net/) and C# that I created to get some practice with Avalonia. It provides a straightforward UI to more easily extract MP3 files from specified YouTube videos. It's a bit rough around the edges, but works for my purposes.

Feel free to use it, but please do so responsibly!

## Prerequisites
- [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp)
- .NET 6

## TODO

- Better UI responsiveness during long operations
- Save the last output directory
- Check into Asian language support
