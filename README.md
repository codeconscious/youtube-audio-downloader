# Youtube Audio Downloader

This is a very simple UI wrapper for [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) using [Avalonia](https://avaloniaui.net/) and C# that I created to get some practice with Avalonia. It provides a straightforward UI to more easily extract MP3 files from specified YouTube videos.

It's a work in (occasional) progress, is rather rough around the edges, and currently must be compiled manually, but works well for my own purposes.

Feel free to use it, but please do so responsibly!
