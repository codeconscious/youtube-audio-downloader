# Youtube Audio Downloader

This is a very simple UI wrapper for [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) using [Avalonia](https://avaloniaui.net/) and C# that I created to get some practice with Avalonia. It provides a straightforward UI to more easily extract MP3 files from specified YouTube videos.

It's a work in (occasional) progress, so is a bit rough around the edges, and it currently must be compiled manually, but works well for my purposes.

Feel free to use it, but please do so responsibly!
